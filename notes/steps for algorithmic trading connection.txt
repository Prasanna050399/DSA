Requirements for Running This Tomorrow
Zerodha Account with sufficient funds and active API subscription.
Kite Connect API Key: Obtain the API key and set up an access token for the Kite Connect platform.
Python Environment with Kite Connect Library: Install required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install kiteconnect pandas
Scheduler Setup (Optional): You may want to schedule the script to run at regular intervals, especially at market open. Use cron jobs or task schedulers as needed.







Requirements and Steps to Use This Algorithm on Zerodha:

Since you already have a Zerodha account, hereâ€™s how to set up and use the algorithm:

Step 1: Set Up Kite API Access

Log in to your Zerodha Console.
Go to "Profile" > "API" and generate an API Key and API Secret by creating an API app with "Kite Connect".
Use these keys in the code to initialize the KiteConnect instance.
Step 2: Install the Kite Connect Python Library

Run this command to install the necessary library:
bash
Copy code
pip install kiteconnect
Step 3: Generate an Access Token

Use the API Key and API Secret to generate a temporary access token daily (Zerodha requires daily renewal for session security).
Alternatively, you can automate token generation using OAuth2 flows, though it might require server configuration.
Step 4: Add Code and Adjust Configurations

Add the API keys and tokens to the code.
Customize any investment caps or filters as needed.
Step 5: Set Up a Scheduler (Optional)

For daily execution, you may use a scheduler, like cron on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows, to run the script at specific intervals during trading hours.
