leet code : 
	reveal cards in increasing order :
		sort the deck
		create a queue with indices in it
		for each card in the deck, pop the position from the queue and use that position in the answer list. At this position place the element from the deck.
		After placing the element, pop from the queue again and append it at the back of the queue.
		so we are simulating the process, placing the element then poping and placing next element to the end.
