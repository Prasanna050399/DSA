what is reactive programming?
	Reactive programming is an important programming paradigm that is becoming increasingly popular with java development.
	it is based on the use of asynchronous and non-blocking data streams to handle data and events.
	
	reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on handling streams of data and events.
	this paradigm uses asynchronous and non-blocking code to handle data streams, making it more efficient and scalable.
	
	This paradigm is based on the idea of reacting to an event instead of blocking and waiting for them.
	reactive programming uses streams of data and events instead of objects and methods. This allows the developers to write code that is more efficient, responsive and resilient
	
	
Reactive Landscape : 
	What is reactive landscape : 
		it refers to various tools, frameworks and patterns that are used for building reactive systems.
		Reactive systems are designed to be responsive, resilient, elastic and message-driven.
		these systems are highly scalable and can handle a large number of requests with minimal resources.
		The Reactive Landscape includes several frameworks and tools, such as Reactive Streams, RxJava, Reactor, Spring Framework, Akka, and Ratpack.
		
Use cases of reactive programming : 
	reactive programming is used in the following use cases : 
		real-time streaming data : 
		web development :
		internet of things :
		big data : 

How it helps developers : 
	helps the developers to : 
		improve performance : 
			reactive programming enables developers to write code that is more responsive and faster.
			reactive applications can handle large amounts of data and process it in real time which helps improve performance
		
		increase scalability : 
			reactive programming allows developers to write code that is more scalable.
			reactive applications can handle a large number of concurrent requests, which helps scale the application to meet the growing demands of the users.
		simplify code :
			helps developers write simpler and more readable code
			provides a set of powerful and easy-to-use APIs that allow developers to write code that is more concise and easy to understand.
