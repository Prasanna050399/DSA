web dev : 	
	https://www.interviewbit.com/web-developer-interview-questions/

	points : 
		what is dom : 
			dom describes the logical structure of the documents and how one can manipulate them.
			These documents are usually treated as a tree structure in which every node is an object that represents a specific part of the document.
		what are drivers and navigators in pair programming : 
			the one that writes code is known as driver 
			and the one that is monitoring the code is known as navigator.
			the roles are inter changable.
		
		what is type coercion in javascript : 
			type coercion means the process of converting value from one data type to another either automatically or implicitly.
		
		difference between window.onload and onDocumentReady : 
			onload triggers when a web page is fully loaded, meaning DOM is loaded along with all the associated resources and then the code is executed
			onDocumentReady triggers when the dom is loaded, meaning other things like images, videos and other contents are not considered while triggering the event.
		
		best way to integrate different stylesheets into a website : 
			as per my understanding, since each angular component have a styles.css, what we can do is create a global style.css that will contain all the generic css information and then we can write any specific css in the local style.css
		
		how do you optimize the loading time of your web application : 
			image compression and optimization 
			put javascript and css in external files
			reduce the number of redirects
			css and javascript files should be loaded asynchronously 
			minify html, css and javascript code.
		
		different pop up objects available in js : 
			alert
			confirm -> okay returns true cancel returns false
			prompt -> has two buttons okay gives the user input value cancel returns null
		
		scope in js : 
			global scope :
			local scope : 
		
		what is ajax : 
			asynchronous javascript and xml :
				ajax refers to a set of technologies which are used for web dev that allows the web application to send and receive data asynchronously from the server without hampering the display or behaviour of the existing site
				
				using ajax we can exchange information from the server and upate a part of a webpage without reloading the entire web page.
				
		CDN in jquery : 
			content delivery networks are geographically distributed groups of servers that deliver internet content quickly.
			the servers are dispersed accross many physical and network locations this can significantly reduce the load times 
		
		what are css selectors :
			css selectors are used to select or specify html elements that they want to style.
				id selector :
					#idName
					So the element with the id idName will have the above css applied to it.
				
				class selector : 
					.className
					so the above css is applied to html element with class = "className"
				
				child selector or combinator : 
					div > p 
					so the above css is applied to all the p elements that are child of the div element
		
		what are pseudo-classes : 	
			This is used to define a special state of an html element.
			in css there are many pseudo-classes but the one that is most frequently used are : 
				selector : pseudo-class {}
			
			they are : 
				: visited 
				: hover 
				: active -> select the element that becomes active when the user clicks on it
				: focus -> select an element that is currently focused by the user.
		
		use of media queries : 
			used in css to create a responsive web design.
			meaning based on the user's screen or media type, the web page will change appearance.
			The following can be checked using media queries : 
				dimensions of the view port
				dimensions of the device
				orientation
				resolution
		
		what is long polling : 
			The client initiates a request to the server, typically through an HTTP request.

			Instead of immediately responding, the server holds the request open, keeping the connection active.

			If no new data is available, the server waits until it has something to send back.

			Once the server has new data or a predefined timeout occurs, it responds to the client with the latest information.

			Upon receiving the response, the client immediately sends another request to the server to maintain the connection.

			This cycle of sending requests and receiving responses continues, ensuring real-time updates.

Converting an array to arrayList : 
	Integer number = new Integer[] {1, 2, 3};
	List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(number);
	
how to create singleton class in java ? 
	1. make all the constructors private
	2. create a static method that returns an instance of that class.
	3. The instance is stored as a private static variable
	
	There are two types of instantiation lazy and early : 
		in lazy instantiation : 
			the instance is created when the method is called. 
			add a condition in the method to check if the private variable is null that is no instance is created as of now. If true, create a new instance. If false return already existing instance.
		in eary instantiation : 
			we can assign the instance to the private variable at the time of defining the variable.
			
what are rest APIs : 
	Rest or representational state transfer is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints that are required for creating web services.
	
	Rest api is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.
	
	Request is made in the form of web url as : 
		GET : read a representation of resource
		POST : create a new resource. Post is neither safe nor idempotent
		PUT : update a new resource. Put is not safe but is idempotent
		DELETE :
	Response is in the form of anything, HTML, XML, Image or JSON.
	
	Idempotent : 
		sending a same request multiple times will produce the same result, without changing the state of the server or the resources
		
	Rest is stateless meaning that the requests are independent of each other or previous requests.

what is web pack in angular ? 	
	webpack is a static module bundler for modern js applications
	we configure the following things in webpack : 
		entry : the module where the webpack should start
		output : where webpack emits the bundles it create
		loaders : enable webpack to process more than just js files
		plugins : perform a wide range of tasks like minification
	All these configurations are kept in file : 
		webpack.config.js
	This file is not there for normal angular application using angular CLI.
	To run the angular application using webpack, after we use ng eject,
	we need to run
	npm run start
	which translates to 
	webpack-dev-server --port=4200

		i still see myself in the development domain
		i want to explore few technologies, so my career goals are aligned with those techonologies, i would be working on them 
		
	what is your role in a team?
		my role in the team was majorly as a developer
		connecting with my seniors for design discussions
		was helping juniors to either review their code or help them with blockers
		connect with our tester
		if there was an issue with the stage environment code, then i also used to help them decode the issue.

	What are some of the workplace successes that make you proud?
		there was a time in the project that I was working on 7 out of 10 tasks that were assigned to me and the dependency on me was so much that everyone was connecting with me. What I am trying to say was that I was able to make myself an important part of the project such that for the designing of version two, I was allowed to take part in the design discussions to check if some points are missed.
		Another one that I consider as success was when an architect was submitting the liscences list to the marketing team, he specifically asked me to check the list created by my team lead again. So that was the trust that i believe i earned.

manager round questions : 
	What is the relationship between leadership and management?
	Have you ever disagreed with coworkers or management? 
		yes there were a few occasions where we had disagreement within the team, but most of them were solved via a discussion. For eg. I was disagreeing with a field included in the table schema and i discussed this with my manager and she was satisfied with my reasoning and she agreed to it.
		There were also few occasions where we had a discussion and people realized that there might be a better way and then it was sorted out.
		There were also some occasions towards the end of my working period where we wanted to complete certain things and i was suggesting a better, but according to some instructions from senior management we didnt consider it and just implemented it. 
		So ideally discussions solved most of the disagreements, but due to some external factors we had to keep our differences aside and complete the task.
		
	what do you think is better service based or product based?
		as far as i understand, it depends on the project we are in, so lets say we are working in a service based organisation but the project is amazing the clients are amazing, they are liking you work and appreciating whatever we are doing, in that case, service base will be better, because, we then have on site opportunities, sometimes incentives, since the project is great, we enjoy working on it. 
		So there are kind of satisfaction both in terms of work and financial. So to some extent this cannot be achieved in product base. But again we hear about the work culture in product based is better that service based.
		so as per me, it depends on the project that we are working on.
		
	How do you introduce new concepts to your team?
	
	Can you please talk about your strength and weaknesses.
		Actually i though about this question few weeks ago so yeah i have an answer to it,
		for strength, I consider perseverance as on of my primary strength, then I also used to consider problem solving, but then i realized that it is like the basic necessity. I am easly motivated, I mean i just need to start thinking about my elder sister and my father and my causins and i get motivated.
		
		then to talk about my weaknesses, i consider that overthinking is probably my biggest weakness, it have some advantages though, you think about all the situations and then sometimes you are prepared for them.
		Then there was this feedback that i got from my manager, which i now believe was right, she used to tell me that learn to say no to people, because what used to happen was people from different teams used to connect for some help, so lets say some developer is having some issue, or our devops guy was facing some issue with stage or prod where she was getting some behaviour which was not preffered. 
	
	Please walk me through your resume
	What made you want to work for us?
		amdocs : 
			I mean the company is a market lead in terms of services provided for media and communication sector, for about 30 to 40 years, and then the job desciption was also aligning with my profile so I wanted to apply.
			
	What do you do if you make a mistake?
		the first thing that i used to do was to inform my manager about the mistake, luckiliy we were working in an environment where we used to follow that we will stop development on wednesday and let the tester test it on thursday and if there were some immediate high priority issues that she used to find, we used to work on it on friday. But in case that the issue was not a minor where it will take some time, then we used to do 2 things, first was add it to the defect sheet and also create an issue on github with the relevent information for developers to understand.
		
	If your thoughts conflict with your co-worker, how would you handle the situation?
	What keeps you going at work?
		i like to write program, so most of the time i am not stopping, but yeah if i feel very low, sometimes i take a break of 10 mins just to cut off from the development. So yeah that keeps me going.
		And i mean, this is what i want to create my career in so it works for me.
		And again if i feel low and nothing is motivating me like really edge case, then i just need to open linkedin and see all my peers working hard and it motivates me.
		also there was this movie which i used to love watching in college and school called bhag milkha bhag, and it used to motivate me.
		
	What should I do to prepare for the managerial interview?
	What do you want to achieve professionally in the long run?
	What will you do if your team is against your idea?
	How do you prioritize work for your team and yourself?
	What does Success mean to you?
		I was in an internal project so unless we sold our project, we didnt have any recognition as such, 
		So there used to be these assessments, so in the assessment, we had a scale out of 5, where 5 was excellent, 3 was you did your job, and 1 was you need to try harder.
		So actually both the manager and the employee used to assess. So i gave myself 3 which was task completed as per expectation and my manager actaully gave me 4 in all.
